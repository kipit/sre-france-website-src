Hi everyone,

I hope you are all doing well.

Following the discussions on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+djs7fX8-2xwyYjJk) we wanted to start sharing ideas and topics in order to prepare the agenda the next SRE meetup.

So if you interested in sharing ideas, proposing a venue to host a future event or suggesting a talk in French or English, don't hesitate to join us!

**In order to facilitate group discussions and to follow the government guidelines this event is limited to 10 attendees**
